To run the program users need to

(1) unzip the ldscore files (current version)

(2) run a command like this
	./ldscdom --sumstat sumstats.txt --ld-score ukb.ldscore --out myOUTPUT

(3) Help ./ldscdom --help

Output:
	Results will be displayed in the standard output (stdout) and log file.
	The [--out myOUTPUT] option generates a file named myOUTPUT.ldscdom.log with the results.
	That file can be read in R as described below:
	
	R> results <- read.table("myOUTPUT.ldscdom.log",h=T,stringsAsFactors=F,sep="\t")
